## Lesson 1
* Gather an exact Time from the NTP server(s) with library - "github.com/beevik/ntp"

* Program must return the correct Exit Code ( 0 - everything is ok, any other number - error)

* In case the remoute NTP server(s) are unavailable, program should return local time.

* All errors from the ntp lib must be handlend accordingly.

* Unit tests are optional.
